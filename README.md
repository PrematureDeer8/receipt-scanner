# receipt-scanner
This project is intended to sort physical receipts by date in an excel spreadsheet. 
First you must obtain an image of your physical receipts as a .jpg. The image must have the receipts with a **black background** so that the receipts are distinguishable.

For example:
![Receipt_2023-04-06_200515](https://github.com/PrematureDeer8/receipt-scanner/assets/25759898/a090b6f5-6aa7-424e-ac8e-46599f26fd34)

This image was created by scanning the receipts on a printer with a black piece of paper as the background.
Once you have an image like mentioned above. Go to the import/export tab of the app

Click Choose files and then select the appropriate file. You can also select multiple files if you want. If you don't see the option to choose files then click on the import/export tab and then the options should appear.
Once you upload the file/files you should see something like this:

Now to submit the images so that the computer read the information. Scroll to the bottom of the app and there is a submit button.

Then click submit and then wait while the computer processes the information. After completion you should see something like this:
(it might be helpful to use full screen)

The highlighted part of the receipts are the sections that the computer read like the date, time, etc. To edit/look at the extrapolated information
click on the name of the receipt. You will see something like this:

Note, if the computer couldn't find one of the pieces of information then it will display as blank. **The two pieces of information that must be filled before converting is the date and time**
If you're content with the data then press the convert button to convert the information to an excel spreadsheet. If you don't know where the file path to the excel spreadsheet, click on the preferences in the import/export tab
and the information should be displayed there. Also if you want to change the path to your Desktop then you can do so in the input field.
